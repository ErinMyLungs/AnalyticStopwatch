# The Meme Branch

###This branch exists only because I spent way too long making this meme and I can't bear to let it's source code go to waste.
### Code
The source for this meme is in src/gui/meme.py. It's total garbage thrown together with no regard for good practices. Memes don't need no unit testing or doc strings!
